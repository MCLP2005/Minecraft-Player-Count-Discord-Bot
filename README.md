# Minecraft-Player-Count-Discord-Bot

What is this?

This is a simple Discord bot script, written in discord.js, which shows the playercount of a Minecraft-server in a playing status.
To use this, you'll need node.js.

To setup the bot, simply edit the "config-example.yml" to your needs and rename it to "config.yml".
Then you run `npm i` from any command-prompt that can run `npm`-commands.
And make sure, `enable-query` is enabled on the Minecraft-server, you're trying to use for it.

Then for executing the bot simply type in `npm start` and hit enter.



if any errors come to life, please write at the issue-tab.



Have fun with the bot! ;D


Kind regards
