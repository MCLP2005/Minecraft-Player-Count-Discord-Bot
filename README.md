# Minecraft-Player-Count-Discord-Bot

What is this?

This is a simple Discord bot script, written in discord.js, which shows the playercount of a Minecraft-server in a playing status.
To use this, you'll need node.js.

To setup the bot, simply edit the "config-example.yml" to your needs and rename it to "config.yml".
Then you run `npm i` from any command-prompt that can run `npm`-commands.

Then for executing the bot simply type in `npm start` and hit enter.



## Feature list:
* [x] List player count
* [x] Display a custom name for the server
* [x] Debug output
* [ ] Use custom refresh interval



If any errors come to life, please write at the issue tab.
If you have feature requests, you can also write them in the issue tab.


Have fun with the bot! ;D


Kind regards
